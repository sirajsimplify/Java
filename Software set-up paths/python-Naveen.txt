1. The source code(.py) will get converted to byte code(.pyc) by compiler and the (.pyc) file will get executed by the PVM(python virtual machine). 
PVM can directly read .py file.

2. Reason to convert source code to byte code is that, the next time when PVM tries to execute the code, it will directly read (.pyc) file and 
execute it which increases the execution speed.

3. To compile python file, use the below code in the pycharm terminal with the proper path along with the command ==> python -m py_compile Datatypes.py

	(venv) C:\Users\Ravi.V\PycharmProjects\Python_Naveen_Core_Concepts\Python_Class1_Practise>python -m py_compile Datatypes.py

	Also, use the below code in editor to compile:
		import py_compile
		py_compile.compile('Datatypes.py')

4. Indentation (alignment)

>>>> Datatypes concept  <<<<

1. No need to declare any type of variable
2. If the number are same then the variables will be pointed to the same identity i.e, if x=10 and y=x. 
	Identities of both the variables x and y will remain the same as both of them having same number
