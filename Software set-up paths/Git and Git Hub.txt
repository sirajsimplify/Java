	Here we re using the Github and the URl is => https://github.com/sirajsimplify/Java => usn: sirajparveez@gmail.com (or) sirajsimplify => pwd: Siraj@121

Command - git remote add origin https://github.com/sirajsimplify/Java.git  (To add a new project in remote server)
	  git push -u origin master (To push the project)

	git remote add upstream  https://github.com/sirajsimplify/Java.git (To update existing project in the github)
	git push -u origin master

	We can directly delete the repository from the project in Github by going to Edit> delete repository
